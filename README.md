# Homework_1

This project is about writing a single-player version of the card game known as 'siete y medio' (seven and a half), 
which is very similar in nature to the casino game of Blackjack (also known as 21). 
The goal of the game is to get cards whose total value comes the closest to 71/2 without going over it. 
Getting a card total over 71/2 is called "busting". 

The files include:

  cards.h: a complete interface for the Card class plus templates for the Hand and Player interfaces.  
  cards.cpp:  an almost complete implementation of the Card class.
  siete_y_medio.cpp: some suggested libraries plus a stub for the main routine
